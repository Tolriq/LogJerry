# LogJerry

LogJerry is a desktop investigation tool for android logs.

It's useful when you should take a at the logs without logcat. It will help you to find information such as JSON easily in the log.  
I frequently investigate android logs and I found there's no proper tool for doing it.
Editors like VS Code, it's hard to see the logs because I can see all the columns and I can't filter out logs.  
So that's why I am making this project. Any feedbacks are welcome!

## Main features

- Filters
- Find keywords in logs
- Toggle columns
- Auto-detect exceptions, JSON objects
- Prettify JSON
